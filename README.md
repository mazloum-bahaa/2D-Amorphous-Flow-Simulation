# 2D Amorphous System Simulation with Obstacle

A C++ simulation of dense amorphous polydisperse systems in a confined geometry with a central obstacle. This research code investigates anisotropic parameter and non-affine displacements in dense amorphous systems.

## 📋 Project Overview

This project simulates a 2D polydisperse system (dense amorphous material) confined in a rectangular channel with a central obstacle. The system undergoes non affine deformation, and various analysis tools are provided to study:
- Steady state detection
- T1 events and non-affine displacements
- Anisotropic behavior vs polydispersity
- Order parameter analysis

The simulation generates data for studying how polydispersity, packing factor and many other parameters affects the dynamics and structural rearrangements in dense systems.

# 2D-Amorphous-Flow-Simulation
Numerical study of a 2D polydisperse amorphous system flowing in a rectangular channel with a central obstacle. Includes C++ simulation code and Python analysis tools for steady-state detection, T1 events, D²min, anisotropy, and order parameter behavior.
# Shear and Shuffle: 2D Polydisperse System Simulation with Obstacle

A C++ simulation of dense amorphous polydisperse systems under shear in a confined geometry with a central obstacle. This research code investigates anisotropic behavior and non-affine displacements in complex fluids.

## 📋 Project Overview

This project simulates a 2D polydisperse system (dense amorphous material) confined in a rectangular channel with a central obstacle. The system undergoes shear deformation, and various analysis tools are provided to study:
- Steady state detection
- T1 events and non-affine displacements
- Anisotropic behavior vs polydispersity
- Order parameter analysis

The simulation generates data for studying how polydispersity affects the mechanical response and structural rearrangements in dense systems.
